Functional Progrraming is predictable
 - Pure Functions
 - Declarative values
 - Immutable state // proctects error even from typos
 - Transparent
 - modular - functions as building blocks // includes currying
 - Easy to test

 Pure function
 - produce the same results every time
 - easy to test inputs and out puts

 Immpure function
 - States are changing
 - un expected results

 Immutable
 - create state, Dont mutate it
 - object.freeze ... stops data from changing
        Reference  https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/
- its safe 
- good with Redux ... it creates states... it creates free redo and undo logs
- less memory usuage .. in certian casses
- 

cons of Immutable
verbose 
more object createion ... leaves data exposed
more garbage collection
more memory usuage

First Class functions
